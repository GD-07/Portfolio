# About the Code
**HTML** <br />
I extensively used div to keep every section and every element seperated from each other to organise the code better and used various tags and attributes to make the skeleton of website like title, a tag , table, img , br, h tag, p tag,form,footer,etc. <br />
**CSS** <br />
I used CSS to style the webpage. I majorly used background commands, flex, font styling(imported a font family),transitions and a lot more to make the website look good.   <br />
**Javascript**
I used Javascript to make the website responsive. I used it make the scrolling to sections from the navbar possible. And I also used javascript to recieve a message from the user and store it.
